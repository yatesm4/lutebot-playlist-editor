# LuteBot Playlist Editor

Its pretty straight forward, but I can understand the confusion from some users. If you're not familiar with hosting a local website, this project isn't for you.

If you do think you're up for it, all you need to do is:
* Configure PHP on your environment
* Figure out a way to host this website locally, and in a way that supports PHP. There is JS, but if you aren't away- that should run just fine out of the box.
* Run the website
* Upload MIDI files into the tool
* Give your playlist a name
* NOTE - this tool will assume all MIDI files are in the same location on your computer. If they aren't, then fix that. Once they're all assembled in the same directory, provide the path to that directory in the tool. Eg, C:\Users\You\Desktop\Midi files

I'm pretty sure thats how it works. I could be wrong, but I didn't put much thought into this tool beyond whipping it together fast.

# Enjoy
